# ocrshark
Optical Character Recognition Shark is a Python package designed to hunt down a given string and click on it. Just a simple script to test some external libraries.

# Usage
1. Download the folder;
2. Inside "detectStr.py", in the last "if" conditional (if \_\_name\_\_=="\_\_main\_\_", change the argument of the main() function;
3. Call it on the command line with the command "python3 detectStr.py" (or "python detectStr.py" if you're on Windows).

# HOW TO STOP THE SCRIPT
If you're wondering how to stop it, just move your mouse cursor as fast as possible to any of the four corners of the primary monitor.
